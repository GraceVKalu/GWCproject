      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>At girlSportscentral we strive to inspire women to be go-getters without being afraid to take a leap of faith, even with the possibility of failure.
        By providing basic information on specific sports and self care, we believe it will take away some of those first day jitters and also convince prospective athletes to sign up in the first place.
        It's important to conquer those first day jitters and convince women to sign up in the first place.
