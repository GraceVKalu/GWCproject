      <p><h2>Rules:</h2></p>
  <hr></hr>
<p>Soccer is played on a huge green field; some people even call it the "football field." Soccer is only played with your feet, so you may not touch the ball with your hands.
<br>
There are a total of eleven players on a soccer team.
<br>
Central defenders: play in the center (middle) of the field and usually cover the opposition's leading goal scorer or center forward(s).
<br>
Midfielders: link between the defense and attack. They must be the most fit on the team since they do the most running.
<br>
You may use either your feet or head to advance the ball and make a goal.
<br>
The only type of player who is permitted to touch the ball with their hands is the goalie. The goalie's purpose is to block the opponent's ball as he or she attempts to kick it into the goal.
<br>
Sometimes there is a situation where the goalie is not allowed to touch the ball with his or her hands, and this is called the back-pass rule.
<br>
A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses the sideline and leaves the field.
<br>
Proper throw-ins: both feet must remain on the ground, and make sure to throw the ball with both hands over your head.
<br>
If a player touches the soccer ball, the other team gets a penalty kick and the person who violated the rules gets their team a red card.
<br>
Corner kicks and Goal kicks: taken when the ball leaves the field across the goal line (the end of the field). If the offensive team kicks it out, the play is restarted with a goal kick. However, if the defensive team kicks it out, the play is restarted with a corner kick instead of a goal kick. Any player can execute the kick.
<br>
The ball must leave the "Penalty Area" before anyone can touch the ball.</p>

<p><h2>Equipment:</h2></p>
<hr></hr>
<p>There are many pieces of equipment necessary for soccer: a soccer ball, cool cleats, shin guards, goalkeeper gloves (for goalies), a soccer uniform, practice t-shirts and shorts, soccer socks, a backpack, and a large bottle for refreshing drinks such as water, gatorade and powerade.</p>
