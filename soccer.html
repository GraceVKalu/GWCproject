      <p>Soccer is the world's most popular sport, mostly played in Europe, Africa, Asia and America. Soccer is a great form of exercise! Each team has eleven players, it is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. No one but the goalie can touch the ball. They can only kick, knee or head the ball to advance it or score the goal. In order to play, you must study the basics of soccer, focus on one skill at a time, play pickup games, improve your fitness, join a team, find a training partner and practice consistently. You will need soccer cleats, a practice t-shirt and shorts, long sport socks, a uniform, a large water bottle, a soccer ball, and shin guards.</p>
