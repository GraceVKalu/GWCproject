      <p><h5>Rules:</h5></p>
<p></p>
<p><h6>Soccer is only played with your feet, so you may not touch the ball with your hands.
<br>
You use either your feet or head to advance the ball and make a goal.
<br>
The only one who is allowed to touch the ball with their hands is the goalie.
<br>
Sometimes there is a situation where the goalie is not allowed to touch the ball with his or her hands, and this is called the back-pass rule.
<br>
A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses the sideline and leaves the field.
<br>
Proper throw-ins: both feet must remain on the ground, and make sure to throw the ball with both hands over your head.
<br>
If a player touches the soccer ball, the other team gets a penalty kick and the person who violated the rules gets their team a red card.
<br>
Corner kicks and Goal kicks: taken when the ball leaves the field across the goal line (the end of the field). If the offensive team kicks it out, the play is restarted with a goal kick. However, if the defensive team kicks it out, the play is restarted with a corner kick instead of a goal kick. Any player can execute the kick.
<br>
The ball must leave the "Penalty Area" before anyone can touch the ball.</h6></p>

<p><h5>Equipment:</h5></p>

<p><h6>There are many pieces of equipment necessary for soccer: a soccer ball, cool cleats, shin guards, goalkeeper gloves (for goalies), a soccer uniform, practice t-shirts and shorts, soccer socks, a backpack, and a large bottle for refreshing drinks such as water, gatorade and powerade.</p></h6>

<p><h5>How to play and become the best soccer player ever:</p></h5>

<p><h6>1. Learn the basics and how each position works.
  <br>
2. Start practicing and get as much practice as possible, even prior to tryouts.
  <br>
3. Make sure to improve your fitness, since soccer is a very active sport and requires the most running.
  <br>
4. Focus on one skill at a time, you don't want to overwhelm yourself.
  <br>
5. Join a team, whether it is part of your school and/or city.
  <br>
6. Play practice games for more team bonding and fun.
  <br>
7. Find a soccer partner: maybe a friend, family member, or a good soccer trainer.
  <br>
8. Practice CONSISTENTLY.</p></h6>
