    <h2>Hydration</h2>
    <h6> Here are some tips on how to get, and stay hydrated. Hydration is essential in sports. If you are not properly hydrated you cannot perform at your best and you are putting yourself in danger, especially if you live in warm or hot places. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are very serious and you may not recognize all the signs. For more information on heat exhaustion and heatstroke visit our <a href="#Injuries">Injuries</a> section.</h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Drink half your body weight in ounces of water each day. If you weigh 120lbs. then drink 60oz. water per day, 150lbs. then 75oz. and so on.
		<li>Your pee should look like lemonade, not apple juice. This might sound gross but it an easy self check to see if you are properly hydrated. If the amount of water you are drinking daily isn't cutting it, increase your intake. Every person's body is different and some may need more or less water than others.</li>
		<li>Start hydrating about 3 days before your sporting event. Whether it is a practice, meet, or game. It takes time for your body to absorb the water.</li>
		<li>Drink your water all throughout the day periodically, not all at one time. Water helps with digestion, and you eat periodically throughout the day so a good rule of thumb is to drink whenever you eat. A good schedule for eating and drinking is: breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, snack, dinner, before bed. To learn more about nutrition check out our <a href="#Nutrition">Nutrition</a> section.</li>
		<li>Gatorade and other hydration/sports drinks are very popular but they are <strong>not</strong> a replacement for water. Sports drinks are high in sugar and glucose, meaning they are good for a “pick me up”  now or replacing lost fluids quickly after. Water should be your main source of hydration as it is the onl liquid your cannot live without. Drink gatorade while actively participating in intense workouts/sports session or after an intense workout/sports session.
    Sports drinks are also beneficial if you could not have a proper meal or snack before your workout. Unlike water, they do have calories and sugar which can help give you energy if your are running on a low tank. They are good for prolonged sporting events that are more than 1-2 hours like tournaments.</li>
